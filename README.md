# Tableau-Citi-Bike Analysis Project

## Introduction

This project provides a detailed analysis of Citi Bike usage patterns in New York City. The analysis includes visualizations created using Tableau Public to explore various aspects of the data, such as trip counts, user types, peak usage hours, trip durations, and station popularity.

## Dashboards

### Dashboard 1: Station and Trip Analysis

#### 1. Map of Start Stations with Trip Counts

Description: This map visualizes the distribution of trip start stations across the city, highlighting the number of trips originating from each station.

Insights: The densest areas, marked by clusters of high trip counts, are located in Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn. These areas are likely to have a high demand for Citi Bikes due to population density and tourist attractions.

#### 2. Map of End Stations with Trip Counts

Description: This map shows where trips terminate, indicating popular destination stations.

Insights: Similar to the start stations, the end stations with the highest trip counts are concentrated in Manhattan. This suggests that many riders use Citi Bikes for short trips within the city.

#### 3. Heatmap of Citi Bike Trip Density

Description: The heatmap illustrates the density of bike trips across the city.

Insights: The heatmap reveals hotspots of bike activity, particularly around central Manhattan and key areas in Brooklyn. These regions see the most significant usage of Citi Bikes, indicating high mobility and accessibility needs.

#### 4. Histogram of Trip Distances

Description: This histogram displays the distribution of trip distances.

Insights: Most trips are short, typically less than 2 miles. This aligns with the expectation that Citi Bikes are primarily used for quick, local transportation rather than long-distance travel.

#### 5. Top 10 Start Stations by Number of Rides

Description: A bar chart showing the top 10 start stations by trip count.

Insights: The most popular start stations are located in busy commercial and residential areas, reflecting high demand for bike rentals in these zones.

#### 6. Top 10 End Stations by Number of Rides

Description: A bar chart showing the top 10 end stations by trip count.

Insights: Popular end stations mirror the start stations, indicating common routes and high utility in specific areas.

### Dashboard 2: Usage and User Analysis

#### 1. Proportion of Casual and Member Users

Description: This pie chart shows the ratio of casual users to members.

Insights: The majority of users are members, suggesting that many people find value in subscribing to the service for regular use.

#### 2. Monthly Total Bike Trips in 2023

Description: A line chart tracking the number of trips each month in 2023.

Insights: There is a noticeable increase in trips during the warmer months (May to October), reflecting seasonal usage patterns where more people use bikes in pleasant weather.

#### 3. Peak Bike Usage Hours by Month

Description: This heatmap indicates peak usage hours throughout different months.

Insights: Peak usage hours are consistent, generally showing high activity during morning and evening rush hours. This pattern is typical of commuter behavior.

#### 4. Average Trip Duration by User Type

Description: A bar chart comparing the average trip duration of casual users and members.

Insights: Casual users tend to have longer trip durations compared to members, possibly because members use the bikes for quick commutes while casual users might be more leisurely or tourist-oriented.

### Dashboard 3: Peak Usage Analysis

#### 1. Peak Usage Hours Heatmap

Description: A heatmap showing peak usage hours for each day of the week and month.

Insights: The highest usage is observed during weekdays' morning and evening hours, correlating with commuting times. Weekends show a more even distribution of usage throughout the day.

#### 2. Trip Duration Distribution by Hour of Day

Description: A line chart displaying the average trip duration at different hours of the day.

Insights: Longer trip durations are more common in the early morning and late evening, possibly due to reduced traffic and leisurely rides.

#### 3. Bike Usage by Day of the Week

Description: A bar chart illustrating the number of trips taken on each day of the week.

Insights: Bike usage is relatively high throughout the week, with a slight dip on Sundays. This indicates steady demand for bikes on both weekdays and weekends.

## Story Point Analysis

### Story Overview

- Description: This section ties together the visualizations from the dashboards to tell a cohesive story about Citi Bike usage patterns.

- Key Trends:
  
  - High Demand Areas: Central Manhattan and Brooklyn are hotspots for bike usage.
    Seasonal Variations: Usage peaks during warmer months and weekdays' commuting      hours.
  - User Behavior: Members use bikes for shorter, more frequent trips, while       
    casual users have longer trips.

### Adding Interactivity

To add filters and interactivity to the dashboards:

1. Select the visualization where you want to add a filter.
2. Click the drop-down arrow in the upper-right corner of the visualization.
3. Select "Filters" and choose the desired filter fields (e.g., date, station name, user type).
4. Adjust the filter settings to allow users to interact with the data and gain deeper insights.

By following these steps and including detailed captions, you create a comprehensive and user-friendly analysis that is accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences.
